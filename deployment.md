Thanks, Rob. Based on what you described, hereâ€™s a logical and practical reconstruction of the likely implementation scenario for how a DevOps team would rebuild the environment from scratch. The goal is to create a structured, repeatable process that assumes the AWS accounts were handed off with Control Tower, networking, and some IAM already configured.

### <a name="pre-reqs"></a>1. Pre-Requisites & Assumptions

* **Accounts exist**: Created via Control Tower (Sandbox, POC, Dev, Stage, Prod)
* **Baseline IAM roles and policies**: Already in place
* **Networking (VPCs, Subnets, Route Tables)**: Pre-configured
* **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Active via AWS Organizations
* **Initial buckets and monitoring**: Already deployed

---

### <a name="phase1"></a>2. Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup (CloudFormation)

> Deployed using an `infrastructure` repo

1. **VPC Setup** (if not already handled by Control Tower landing zone)
2. **Security Groups**
3. **IAM Roles for ECS, ECR, and CodeBuild**
4. **ECR Repositories** (for Spring Boot & React images)
5. **CloudWatch Log Groups**
6. **ECS Cluster**

---

### <a name="phase2"></a>3. Phase 2: Platform Services

> Also deployed via CloudFormation or via Service Catalog

1. **Aurora PostgreSQL** (RDS cluster with secrets managed by Secrets Manager or SSM)
2. **Redis (ElastiCache)** setup
3. **Data Migration Service (DMS)** resources
4. **Any base S3 buckets for app logging or asset storage**

---

### <a name="phase3"></a>4. Phase 3: Application Build & Containerization

> Driven from Spring Boot & React Repos

1. **Build Spring Boot app locally or in CI (GitLab, GitHub Actions, etc.)**
2. **Build React frontend**
3. **Push Docker images to ECR**

   * Tag with `latest` or a version (depending on template usage)
4. **Validate ECR has latest versions before deploying ECS services**

---

### <a name="phase4"></a>5. Phase 4: ECS Services Deployment

> Must reference cluster, image URI, and roles from previous steps

1. **ECS Task Definitions** (Spring Boot and React, possibly sidecars)
2. **ECS Services** (attach to the correct cluster)
3. **ALB/NLB (if needed)** with target groups and listeners
4. **Auto Scaling policies (optional)**

---

### <a name="phase5"></a>6. Configuration & Integration

1. **Secrets and Parameters Setup**

   * Ensure environment variables are injected (DB endpoints, Redis URIs, secrets)
2. **DNS entries**

   * Route 53 or externally managed DNS to point to ALB endpoints
3. **Monitoring & Alarms**

   * CloudWatch alarms for ECS, RDS, etc.
4. **Log forwarding**

   * To CloudWatch, Splunk, or a central SIEM

---

### <a name="phase6"></a>7. Testing & Validation

1. **Health check ALB routes**
2. **ECS task log validation**
3. **Connectivity tests**: Spring Boot to RDS and Redis
4. **User interface test**: React app availability and behavior

---

### <a name="notes"></a>8. Notes on Observed Deployment Issues

* **Cluster must exist before ECS services**: Ensure the CFN dependency chain reflects this.
* **Images must be in ECR before ECS CFN**: Either make the ECR push a prerequisite or include a check.
* **Frequent reprovisioning**: Clean up stale resources and ensure idempotency in templates.
* **Use parameters or mappings in CFN** to abstract environment-specific differences.
